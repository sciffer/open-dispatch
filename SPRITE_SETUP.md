# Sprite Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up **Sprites** for running AI agents in isolated, ephemeral sandbox environments. Two sandbox types are supported:

- **Fly.io** (default) — ephemeral Fly Machines with real-time output streaming
- **GitHub Actions** — workflow runs on GitHub's infrastructure (one-shot jobs only)

## What is Open-Dispatch?

Open-Dispatch is a **relay** — it routes messages between chat providers (Slack, Teams, Discord) and AI agents. That's it.

Open-Dispatch does **not**:
- Store files, screenshots, or build artifacts
- Build Docker images or host container registries
- Run agents itself (agents run in Sprites or locally)
- Manage cloud storage (S3, R2, etc.)

In Sprite mode, Open-Dispatch orchestrates Fly Machines and relays their output to chat. The agent image, its tools, and any file storage are **your responsibility**.

## What are Sprites?

Sprites are ephemeral sandbox environments that:
- Provide **isolated environments** per job (no state pollution between tasks)
- Support **one-shot jobs** (spawn, run, terminate) and optionally **persistent sessions** (Fly sandbox only)
- Stream agent output **back to chat in real-time** via HTTP webhooks (Fly sandbox) or batch via API polling (GitHub sandbox)
- Run on [Fly.io Machines](https://fly.io/docs/machines/) (Fly sandbox) or [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) (GitHub sandbox)

```

**How it works:**
1. User runs `/od-run <task>` in any chat provider
2. Open-Dispatch creates a Job with a unique ID and auth token
3. Open-Dispatch spawns a Fly Machine via the [Machines API](https://fly.io/docs/machines/api/)
4. The Sprite's sidecar (`sprite-reporter`) clones the repo and runs the agent
5. Agent output is POSTed to Open-Dispatch's webhook server over Fly.io's private network
6. Open-Dispatch relays output to the chat channel in real-time
7. When the agent finishes, the Sprite reports final status and auto-destroys

### The Fresh-Clone Pattern

Every Sprite starts clean — fresh VM, fresh clone. All state lives in git, not in the Machine. This means Sprites are fully disposable and the typical workflow is:

1. `/od-run --repo owner/project --branch main "fix the failing tests and open a PR"`
2. Sprite clones, fixes tests, pushes a PR, auto-destroys
3. You review the PR and want changes
4. `/od-run --repo owner/project --branch fix-tests "address the review comments on PR #42"`
5. A new Sprite clones the branch (with all commits from step 2), makes changes, pushes, auto-destroys

There's no state to lose because every commit is in git. Each Sprite picks up exactly where the last one left off. If a Sprite times out or fails, just run another one — it'll clone the latest state and keep going.

## Prerequisites

- A [Fly.io](https://fly.io) account
- Fly CLI installed (`brew install flyctl` or see [docs](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/))
- A Docker image with your agent tools and the Open-Dispatch sidecar installed

## Step 1: Create a Fly App for Sprites

```bash
# Login to Fly.io
fly auth login

# Create an app for your Sprites (this is just a namespace — no deployment yet)
fly apps create my-sprites
```

## Step 2: Get a Fly.io API Token

```bash
# Create a deploy token scoped to your app
fly tokens create deploy -x 999999h

# Copy the token — this is your FLY_API_TOKEN
```

## Step 3: Build Your Agent Image with Sidecar

Open-Dispatch publishes a **sidecar image** containing the webhook relay scripts.
Install it into your agent image using multi-stage Docker build:

```dockerfile
# Pull the sidecar scripts
FROM ghcr.io/bobum/open-dispatch/sidecar:latest AS sidecar

# Your agent base image
FROM node:22-bookworm

# Install the sidecar (sprite-reporter + output-relay.js)
COPY --from=sidecar /sidecar/ /usr/local/bin/

# Install your agent tools
RUN npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Install any other dependencies your agents need
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git curl jq && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /workspace

# Use sprite-reporter as the entry point
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/sprite-reporter"]
```

Build and push to Fly.io registry:
```bash
fly auth docker
docker build -t registry.fly.io/my-sprites/agent:latest .
docker push registry.fly.io/my-sprites/agent:latest
```

## Step 4: Deploy Open-Dispatch to Fly.io

Open-Dispatch itself also runs as a Fly Machine. It needs to be on the same
Fly.io private network (6PN) as the Sprites so they can communicate via
`.internal` DNS.

```bash
cd open-dispatch
fly launch   # Creates app and fly.toml
fly deploy
```

## Step 5: Configure Environment

Add to your `.env` (or set as Fly secrets):

```bash
# Required: Chat provider
CHAT_PROVIDER=slack   # or: teams, discord

# Required: Fly.io Sprite config
FLY_API_TOKEN=your-fly-api-token
FLY_SPRITE_APP=my-sprites
SPRITE_IMAGE=registry.fly.io/my-sprites/agent:latest

# Optional: Webhook URL (default uses Fly.io private networking)
# OPEN_DISPATCH_URL=http://open-dispatch.internal:8080

# Per-provider config (see platform setup guides)
# Slack:   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN, SLACK_APP_TOKEN, SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET
# Teams:   TEAMS_APP_ID, TEAMS_APP_PASSWORD
# Discord: DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN, DISCORD_CLIENT_ID

# Passed through to Sprites automatically:
# GH_TOKEN=your-github-token
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key
# OPENCODE_AUTH_JSON='{"github-copilot":{"type":"oauth",...}}'  # See "Using GitHub Copilot in Sprites"
```

## Step 6: Run

```bash
npm run start:sprite
```

This starts:
- The chat provider (Slack/Teams/Discord) connection
- The webhook server on port 8080 (receives output from Sprites)
- The stale job reaper (cleans up timed-out jobs every 60s)

## Usage

### One-Shot Jobs (`/od-run`)

Run a single task in a fresh Sprite:
```
/od-run --repo owner/project "run the tests"
/od-run --image my-custom:v1 --repo owner/project "lint the code"
/od-run --branch feature-x --repo owner/project "fix the failing tests"
```

Options:
- `--repo <owner/repo>` - GitHub repository to clone
- `--branch <name>` - Branch to checkout (default: main)
- `--image <image>` - Docker image (overrides SPRITE_IMAGE)

### Persistent Sessions (`/od-start --persistent`)

Start a long-running Sprite that maintains state between messages:
```
/od-start mybot --repo owner/project --persistent
```

Then chat normally:
```
"run the tests"
"fix the failing tests"
"commit the changes"
```

Stop when done:
```
/od-stop mybot
```

### List Jobs (`/od-jobs`)

View recent job history:
```
/od-jobs
```

## Webhook Endpoints

The webhook server runs on port 8080 and exposes these endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Body | Purpose |
|----------|--------|------|---------|
| `/health` | GET | — | Liveness check for Fly.io |
| `/webhooks/logs` | POST | `{jobId, text}` | Real-time agent output |
| `/webhooks/status` | POST | `{jobId, status, exitCode, error}` | Job state transitions |
| `/webhooks/artifacts` | POST | `{jobId, artifacts: [{name, url, type}]}` | PR URLs, test logs, etc. |

All webhook calls require `Authorization: Bearer <JOB_TOKEN>` — a per-job token
generated by Open-Dispatch and passed to the Sprite at spawn time.

## The Sidecar: How Sprites Talk to Open-Dispatch

The sidecar is the **client side** of Open-Dispatch's webhook protocol. It exists so your agent images don't need to know the webhook details — just install the sidecar and use `sprite-reporter` as your entrypoint.

The sidecar image contains two scripts:

**`sprite-reporter`** (Bash) — Entry point for Sprite Machines:
1. Validates required env vars (`JOB_ID`, `JOB_TOKEN`, `OPEN_DISPATCH_URL`, `COMMAND`)
2. Clones the repo (if `REPO` is set)
3. Runs the agent command
4. Pipes output through `output-relay.js`
5. Reports final status to `/webhooks/status`

**`output-relay.js`** (Node.js) — Buffered output relay:
- Reads agent stdout line-by-line
- Buffers output for 500ms or 20 lines
- POSTs chunks to `/webhooks/logs`
- Passes through to stdout for Fly.io log capture

**Runtime requirements:** Node.js (for output-relay.js), bash, curl, git, jq

**`:latest` auto-updates:** The sidecar is published to GHCR. When you `COPY --from=ghcr.io/bobum/open-dispatch/sidecar:latest` in your Dockerfile, each `docker build` pulls the latest version (unless cached). To pin a specific version, use the SHA tag instead of `:latest`.

## Choosing an Agent CLI

Your Sprite image needs an AI agent CLI installed. Open-Dispatch supports two:

| | OpenCode | Claude Code CLI |
|---|---|---|
| **Providers** | 75+ (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Copilot, Ollama, etc.) | Anthropic only |
| **Auth** | API keys or OAuth (e.g., GitHub Copilot subscription) | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| **Install** | `npm install -g opencode-ai` | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |
| **Best for** | Flexibility, using existing Copilot/OpenAI subscriptions | Simplicity, Anthropic-only workflows |

**Use OpenCode** if you want provider flexibility — especially if you have a GitHub Copilot subscription (see [Using GitHub Copilot in Sprites](#using-github-copilot-in-sprites)). **Use Claude Code CLI** if you only need Anthropic models and want the simplest setup.

You can install both in the same image and switch via `SPRITE_AGENT_TYPE` (`opencode` or `claude`).

### Permissions in Headless Sprites

Sprites run without a human at the terminal, so the agent CLI must auto-approve all actions.

**Claude Code CLI** — pass the flag in the command:
```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "your task"
```

**OpenCode** — there is no CLI flag equivalent. Instead, add an `opencode.json` to your repo root (or bake one into your Docker image at `/workspace/opencode.json`):
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "permission": "allow"
}
```

This auto-approves all file edits, shell commands, and tool use. See the [OpenCode permissions docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/permissions) for granular control (e.g., allowing edits but denying `rm *`).

> **Note:** This is the image builder's responsibility. If your Sprite image uses OpenCode and doesn't have permissions configured, the agent will hang waiting for approval that never comes.

## Sprite Lifecycle

Sprites are ephemeral — they spin up, do their work, and shut down. Here's when they terminate:

**One-shot jobs** (`/od-run`):
1. Agent command finishes → sidecar POSTs final status → Fly Machine **auto-destroys** (`auto_destroy: true`)
2. If the agent hangs → OD's **stale job reaper** (runs every 60s) marks jobs as timed out after **10 minutes** of inactivity and destroys the Machine
3. If OD's timeout fires first → the job Promise resolves with a timeout error and OD destroys the Machine

**Persistent sessions** (`/od-start --persistent`):
- Machine stays alive between messages (`auto_destroy: false`, `restart: always`)
- Manually stopped with `/od-stop`
- OD calls the Machines API to stop/destroy on command

**Cost implications**: One-shot Sprites only bill for active compute time. Once the Machine auto-destroys, billing stops. Persistent sessions bill until you stop them.

## Custom Agent Images

### Claude Code Agent
```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/bobum/open-dispatch/sidecar:latest AS sidecar
FROM node:22-bookworm

COPY --from=sidecar /sidecar/ /usr/local/bin/
RUN npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git curl jq && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
WORKDIR /workspace
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/sprite-reporter"]
```

### OpenCode Agent
```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/bobum/open-dispatch/sidecar:latest AS sidecar
FROM golang:1.22-bookworm

COPY --from=sidecar /sidecar/ /usr/local/bin/
RUN go install github.com/opencode-ai/opencode@latest
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git curl jq nodejs && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
WORKDIR /workspace
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/sprite-reporter"]
```

### .NET API Agent (with database access)
```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/bobum/open-dispatch/sidecar:latest AS sidecar
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:10.0-bookworm-slim

COPY --from=sidecar /sidecar/ /usr/local/bin/
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git curl jq nodejs npm && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
RUN npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
WORKDIR /workspace
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/sprite-reporter"]
```

## What You Own vs What OD Owns

| Responsibility | Owner |
|---|---|
| Chat provider config (Slack/Teams/Discord tokens) | You |
| Fly.io account, app, API token | You |
| Agent Docker image (base image, tools, deps) | You |
| Sidecar scripts (webhook protocol) | Open-Dispatch |
| Spawning/destroying Sprite Machines | Open-Dispatch |
| Relaying output to chat in real-time | Open-Dispatch |
| Per-job auth tokens | Open-Dispatch |
| Artifact storage (screenshots, videos, etc.) | You (in your agent image) |
| GitHub tokens, API keys | You (set as Fly secrets, passed through to Sprites) |

## Artifact Handling

Open-Dispatch **relays artifact URLs** — it does not store files.

Your agent image is responsible for uploading artifacts to external storage (S3, R2, GitHub, etc.). The Sprite then POSTs the URL to `/webhooks/artifacts` and Open-Dispatch shows it in chat.

**Example flow:**
1. Playwright test runs in a Sprite and takes a screenshot
2. Agent uploads the screenshot to S3 (using tools in your agent image)
3. Agent POSTs `{jobId, artifacts: [{name: "screenshot.png", url: "https://s3.../screenshot.png", type: "image"}]}` to `/webhooks/artifacts`
4. Open-Dispatch relays the URL to Slack/Teams/Discord

| `FLY_REGION` | No | `iad` | Preferred Fly.io region |
| `SPRITE_AGENT_TYPE` | No | `claude` | Agent CLI: `claude` or `opencode` |

### Sprite (injected automatically)

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `JOB_ID` | Unique job identifier |
| `JOB_TOKEN` | Auth token for webhook calls |
| `OPEN_DISPATCH_URL` | Webhook base URL |
| `REPO` | GitHub repo to clone (owner/repo) |
| `BRANCH` | Git branch |
| `COMMAND` | Agent command to execute |
| `GH_TOKEN` | GitHub token (passed through from host) |

| `OPENCODE_AUTH_JSON` | OpenCode auth.json contents (for Copilot/provider auth) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Database URL (passed through if set on host) |

## Using GitHub Copilot in Sprites

If you have a GitHub Copilot subscription, you can use it with OpenCode in Sprites — no separate API key needed. The sidecar automatically injects OpenCode credentials when the `OPENCODE_AUTH_JSON` env var is set.

### Setup

1. **Auth once locally** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   opencode auth login   # Select GitHub Copilot → complete device flow
   ```

2. **Set the Fly secret** with your local auth.json:
   ```bash
   fly secrets set OPENCODE_AUTH_JSON="$(cat ~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json)"
   ```

3. **That's it.** The sidecar writes the credentials to `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json` inside the Sprite before the agent starts. No interactive login required.

### How it works

- OpenCode stores provider credentials in `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`
- The GitHub OAuth token from the device flow is long-lived (no expiry)
- The sidecar's `sprite-reporter` writes `OPENCODE_AUTH_JSON` to disk at startup
- OpenCode picks up the credentials and authenticates with Copilot automatically

### Notes

- This works for **any** OpenCode provider credentials, not just Copilot
- If the token is revoked on GitHub, re-run `opencode auth login` locally and update the Fly secret
- The auth.json is written with `chmod 600` (owner-only read/write)

## Troubleshooting

### "Missing required env vars"
Set `FLY_API_TOKEN`, `FLY_SPRITE_APP`, `SPRITE_IMAGE`, and `CHAT_PROVIDER` in your `.env`.

### "Failed to spawn Sprite"
- Check your Fly.io token: `fly auth whoami`
- Verify the image exists: `fly image show your-image`
- Check region availability: `fly platform regions`

### Sprites can't reach Open-Dispatch
- Ensure both Open-Dispatch and Sprites are in the same Fly.io organization
- Fly.io 6PN (private networking) requires apps in the same org
- Check the webhook URL uses `.internal` DNS

### Agent output not appearing in chat
- Check `/health` endpoint: `curl http://open-dispatch.internal:8080/health`
- Verify the sidecar is installed: the Sprite image must have `/usr/local/bin/sprite-reporter`
- Check Fly.io logs: `fly logs -a your-sprite-app`

### Job timed out
- Default timeout is 10 minutes
- The stale job reaper runs every 60 seconds
- Check if the agent command is hanging

## GitHub Actions Sandbox

As an alternative to Fly.io Machines, Open-Dispatch can run agents via **GitHub Actions workflows**. This is useful when you already have a GitHub Actions setup and prefer not to manage Fly.io infrastructure.

### Key Differences from Fly Sandbox

| Feature | Fly Sandbox | GitHub Sandbox |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Infra required** | Fly.io account, app, API token | GitHub PAT with `workflow` scope |
| **Output delivery** | Real-time via HTTP webhooks (Fly.io 6PN) | Batch via GH API polling after completion |
| **Persistent sessions** | Supported | Not supported (one-shot only) |
| **Sidecar needed** | Yes (Docker image with `sprite-reporter`) | No (workflow YAML runs directly on GH runner) |
| **Output formatters** | Supported (in sidecar) | Not applicable |
| **Billing** | Fly.io usage-based compute | GitHub Actions included minutes |

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository you can trigger workflows in
- A GitHub personal access token (PAT) with **workflow** scope: `repo` + `workflow`
- The workflow file installed in your repo (see below)

### Step 1: Install the Workflow Template

Copy the workflow template to your repository:

```bash
# From the open-dispatch repo:
cp sidecar/github-actions-workflow.yml /path/to/your-repo/.github/workflows/open-dispatch-sprite.yml
```

The workflow accepts two inputs:
- `command` — the agent command to execute (required)
- `agent_type` — `claude` or `opencode` (default: `claude`)

You can customize the workflow (e.g., add secrets, install additional tools, configure caching). The only requirement is that `inputs.command` is executed in a step.

### Step 2: Configure Environment

Add to your `.env`:

```bash
# Select the GitHub sandbox
SPRITE_SANDBOX=github

# GitHub credentials
GITHUB_SPRITE_TOKEN=ghp_your-token-here
GITHUB_SPRITE_OWNER=your-org-or-username
GITHUB_SPRITE_REPO=your-repo-name

# Optional: custom workflow file path (default: .github/workflows/open-dispatch-sprite.yml)
# GITHUB_SPRITE_WORKFLOW=.github/workflows/open-dispatch-sprite.yml

# Optional: branch to run on (default: main)
# GITHUB_SPRITE_BRANCH=main
```

### Step 3: Start

```bash
npm run start:sprite
```

### How Output Delivery Works

Unlike the Fly sandbox (which streams output in real-time via webhooks), the GitHub sandbox polls the GH API:

1. Open-Dispatch triggers `workflow_dispatch` via the GH API (POST → 204)
2. Polls the runs list every 1s up to 30s to discover the new run ID
3. Polls run status every 5s until `status === "completed"`
4. Fetches logs via `GET /actions/runs/{id}/logs` (zip), extracts via `unzip -p`
5. Calls `job.onComplete()` with the collected logs, exit code, and conclusion

This means output is delivered **in a batch after completion**, not line-by-line during execution. The user sees the full agent output at once when the workflow finishes.

### Limitations

- **One-shot jobs only** — persistent sessions (`/od-start --persistent`) are not supported
- **No real-time streaming** — output is delivered after the workflow completes
- **No artifact webhooks** — artifacts are not relayed (the `GithubActionsOrchestrator` doesn't expose artifact endpoints)
- **No sidecar** — the workflow runs directly, so output formatting is minimal
- **GitHub API rate limits** — 5,000 req/h for authenticated users; each job makes ~120 requests (polling 5s for 10 min), well within limits

### Environment Variables Reference

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SPRITE_SANDBOX` | Yes | — | Set to `github` to enable |
| `GITHUB_SPRITE_TOKEN` | Yes | — | GitHub PAT with `workflow` scope |
| `GITHUB_SPRITE_OWNER` | Yes | — | GitHub owner or organization |
| `GITHUB_SPRITE_REPO` | Yes | — | GitHub repository name |
| `GITHUB_SPRITE_WORKFLOW` | No | `.github/workflows/open-dispatch-sprite.yml` | Workflow file path |
| `GITHUB_SPRITE_BRANCH` | No | `main` | Branch to run on |

### Security Notes for GH Sandbox

- The `GITHUB_SPRITE_TOKEN` needs `workflow` scope to dispatch workflows and read run status/logs
- The token is used for all API calls: dispatch, polling, log fetching, and cancellation
- Consider using a fine-grained PAT scoped to a single repo
- The agent command runs as a workflow step — it can access any secrets configured on the repo
- Workflow runs appear in the repo's Actions tab and are visible to users with repo access

## Security Notes

- **Job tokens are per-job**: Each Sprite gets a unique HMAC token valid only for its job
- **Private networking**: Webhooks travel over Fly.io 6PN (WireGuard mesh), not the public internet
- **No shared secrets**: Sprites cannot access other jobs' data
- API tokens and secrets are injected via env vars, never baked into images
- Use `GH_TOKEN` with minimal required scopes
